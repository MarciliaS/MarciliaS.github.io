            ðŸŽ®This flashcard game was created to make learning fun and interactive. The goal is to help players practice vocabulary by flipping cards to see words, images, and their translations.
            </p>
            <p>
            ðŸŽ®You can choose different categories (like fruits or animals) from the menu, and each card will show the word in Portuguese on one side and its English translation with an image on the other.
            </p>
            <p>
            ðŸŽ®The game is designed to be simple, colorful, and engaging â€” whether youâ€™re learning new words, testing your memory, or just having fun with friends and family.
